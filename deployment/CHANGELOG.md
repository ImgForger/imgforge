# Deployment Scripts Changelog

## Latest Changes

### Grafana Dashboard Auto-Download (Current)

**Problem:** The Grafana dashboard was empty after deployment because the `imgforge-dashboard.json` file was not being copied to the deployment directory.

**Solution:** Added automatic dashboard download functionality to the deployment script:

- Downloads the pre-built Grafana dashboard from GitHub during deployment
- Supports both `curl` and `wget` for downloading
- Provides graceful fallback with user instructions if download fails
- Dashboard is automatically provisioned in Grafana on startup

**Files Modified:**
- `deployment/deploy.sh` - Added dashboard download logic
- `deployment/README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect dashboard inclusion
- `deployment/SUMMARY.md` - Added dashboard feature to feature list
- `README.md` - Mentioned pre-built dashboards in main README

**What happens now:**
1. When monitoring is enabled, the script downloads `imgforge-dashboard.json`
2. The file is placed in `~/.imgforge/grafana-dashboards/`
3. Docker Compose mounts this directory to Grafana's provisioning path
4. Grafana automatically loads the "ImgForge Monitoring Dashboard" on startup

**User experience:**
- Dashboard is immediately available at login (no manual import needed)
- Displays all imgforge metrics: HTTP requests, cache hits, processing times, etc.
- Pre-configured with useful visualizations and panels

### Previous Fixes

#### ASCII Art Alignment Fix

**Problem:** The imgforge ASCII logo in the deployment script had spacing issues, causing misalignment.

**Solution:** 
- Widened the box border by one character on each side
- Adjusted spacing for each logo line to center properly
- Verified alignment across different terminal widths

#### Root Warning Removal

**Problem:** The script displayed a warning when run as root, which was unnecessary and could confuse users.

**Solution:** Removed the `check_root()` function call from the main deployment flow.

#### Color Code Display Fix

**Problem:** Color codes were not rendering correctly in cache and monitoring configuration prompts (showed as `\033[0;32m` instead of colors).

**Solution:** Added `-e` flag to all `echo` statements containing color codes:
- Cache configuration menu
- Monitoring configuration menu
- All colored output throughout the script

## Testing

All changes have been validated with:
- Bash syntax checking: `bash -n deploy.sh`
- Manual testing of dashboard download
- Verification of file structure
- URL accessibility check for dashboard JSON

## Deployment Structure

After these changes, a successful deployment with monitoring creates:

```
~/.imgforge/
├── .env
├── docker-compose.yml
├── prometheus/
│   └── prometheus.yml
├── grafana-dashboards/
│   ├── dashboard-provisioning.yml
│   └── imgforge-dashboard.json  ← Now automatically downloaded
└── grafana-datasources.yml
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for consideration:
- [ ] Support for custom dashboard URLs or local files
- [ ] Dashboard versioning and update checks
- [ ] Multiple dashboard support (overview, detailed, alerting)
- [ ] Dashboard backup before updates
- [ ] Offline mode with embedded dashboards
