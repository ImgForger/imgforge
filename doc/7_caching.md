# 7. Caching

Caching dramatically reduces repeated processing costs and shrinks latency for popular images. imgforge integrates with the [Foyer](https://foyer-rs.github.io/foyer/) cache engine to offer three backends: in-memory, disk, and hybrid. This document explains how to configure each mode and how the cache interacts with the request lifecycle.

## How caching works

- **Key derivation**: The cache key is the full request path (including processing options, `cache_buster`, and output format). Different signatures or parameters yield different cache entries.
- **Population**: After successfully processing an image, imgforge inserts the rendered bytes into the configured cache backend.
- **Invalidation**: Caches are size-limited, so least-recently-used entries are evicted automatically. Use the `cache_buster` option to force a miss when you update upstream assets.

Metrics:

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cache_hits_total{cache_type="memory|disk|hybrid"}` | Number of successful lookups. |
| `cache_misses_total{cache_type="..."}` | Number of misses (including disabled caches). |

## Enabling a cache backend

Set `IMGFORGE_CACHE_TYPE` to one of `memory`, `disk`, or `hybrid`. If unset, the cache is disabled and every request hits the processing pipeline.

### Common environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IMGFORGE_CACHE_TYPE` | Backend selector: `memory`, `disk`, or `hybrid`. |
| `IMGFORGE_CACHE_MEMORY_CAPACITY` | Maximum number of items retained in memory (default `1000`). Applies to memory and hybrid caches. |
| `IMGFORGE_CACHE_DISK_PATH` | Directory for on-disk storage. Required for disk and hybrid caches. Ensure it exists and is writable before starting the server. |
| `IMGFORGE_CACHE_DISK_CAPACITY` | Maximum number of entries stored on disk (default `10000`). |

### Memory cache

Configure for short-lived services or low-latency responses:

```bash
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_TYPE=memory
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_MEMORY_CAPACITY=5000
```

- Backed entirely by RAM.
- Fastest option but volatile—entries are lost on restart.
- Ideal for front-line edge nodes where disk is unavailable.

### Disk cache

Persist cache entries across restarts using local or network storage:

```bash
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_TYPE=disk
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_DISK_PATH=/var/cache/imgforge
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_DISK_CAPACITY=20000
```

- Uses Foyer’s block engine to store bytes on disk.
- Suitable when CPU-intensive renders must be reused across deploys.
- Place `/var/cache/imgforge` on SSD-backed storage to minimize latency.

### Hybrid cache

Combine a memory hot set with disk-backed persistence:

```bash
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_TYPE=hybrid
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_MEMORY_CAPACITY=5000
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_DISK_PATH=/var/cache/imgforge
export IMGFORGE_CACHE_DISK_CAPACITY=50000
```

- Frequently accessed objects stay in memory; less popular ones spill to disk.
- Balances latency and durability for high-traffic services.

## Operational tips

1. **Provision storage** – Ensure the disk path exists and ownership matches the user running imgforge. For containers, mount a persistent volume at the desired location.
2. **Monitor hit ratios** – Scrape Prometheus metrics and alert on low hit rates; adjust memory capacity or investigate signature churn.
3. **Warm caches** – Precompute popular assets by hitting imgforge ahead of peak traffic. Automate via a job triggered after deploys.
4. **Eviction strategy** – Cache capacity is entry-based. If stored objects vary significantly in size, monitor disk usage separately and prune old entries if necessary.
5. **Security** – When storing on shared disks, restrict permissions (`0700`) to the imgforge user to prevent other processes from reading cached content.
6. **Replication** – imgforge does not provide distributed caching. For multi-node deployments, rely on CDN layers or object storage if cross-node sharing is required.

## Troubleshooting caching issues

- **Misses despite configuration**: Confirm `IMGFORGE_CACHE_TYPE` is set and no typos exist. Check logs for `Failed to initialize cache` messages.
- **Permission denied**: Ensure the disk directory is writable. In containers, mount with the correct UID/GID or use `chown` during image build.
- **Unexpected eviction**: Increase `IMGFORGE_CACHE_*_CAPACITY` values and monitor resource usage. Also verify that `cache_buster` values are not changing unnecessarily.
